# Shatter

**Shatter** is an addon for Blender that allows the creation of segments (parts of levels) for the mobile game *Smash Hit*. Currently, it can handle boxes, obstacles, decals and water to the degree that it should be possible to create segments which look official.

## Usage and help

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/Shatter-Team/Shatter/wiki) for information about how to use the addon, as well as some technical information about Smash Hit and the mesh baker.
