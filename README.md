# Smash Hit Tools for Blender

**Smash Hit Tools for Blender** is an addon for Blender that allows the creation of segments (parts of levels) for the mobile game *Smash Hit*. Currently, it can handle boxes, obstacles, decals and water to the degree that it should be possible to create segments which look official.

## Help

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/knot126/Smash-Hit-Blender-Tools/wiki) for information about how to use the addon, as well as some technical information about Smash Hit and the mesh baker.

## Mesh baker

This repo also contains a project to create a mesh file baker to be used as part of these tools, though it can also be used by itself. See [`bake_mesh.py`](bake_mesh.py).
