			<h3>User IDs</h3>
			<p>Each install of Shatter is given a random user ID that is generated on your device. This user ID is never submitted to servers, but may be included in your segment's XML file if you have the "Export metadata" option enabled in Shatter preferences.</p>
<!-- 			<p>We currently only use user IDs to block users from using Shatter in some extreme cases. We do not send your user ID to the server for this check; instead, we download a list of all blocked user IDs and compare yours against them on your device.</p> -->
<!-- 			<p>Please note that using segment protection featuers, like Segstrate, might require that you enable "Export metadata" and therefore export user IDs.</p> -->
			<h3>Connection to external services</h3>
			<p>Shatter developers do not use online services to store personal information unless you explicitly provide it to us; however, there are <b>some features of Shatter that connect to the internet</b> which may <b>collect personally identifiable information</b>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The automatic updater <b>requests files from GitHub servers</b> in some cases. Please see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">GitHub's privacy statement</a>.</li>
				<li>Shatter may <b>download a list of SHA1 user ID hashes</b> to see if your user ID has been blocked from using Shatter.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Note: Due to bugs, this is disabled in current versions of Shatter.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><s>Some versions of Shatter <b>may have opt-in telemetry options</b>, which will submit crash reports to our logging service.</s></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Note: The telemetry endpoints were taken down on 31 July 2023 and will no longer collect information.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h3>Hosting or creating local network services</h3>
			<p>There are also features which require hosting a webserver, which <b>might be exposed to the public</b> if your network is configured incorrectly:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The quick test feature requires <b>hosting a webserver</b> which does not serve anything but files at semi-hardcoded file paths.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Automatic update security</h3>
			<p>We use code signing to verify that updates come from the original developers of Shatter, even in the event that an account is hacked; however, code signing like this could still fail if an attacker has access to private keys needed to sign Shatter updates. Since Blender addons run an unsandboxed version of python, this means a malicous update could be able to install malicous software, like malware or viruses, if a developer is successfully attacked. You shouldn't enable automatic updates if you are concerned about running bad programs.</p>
			<h3>Disabling network connectivity and other features</h3>
			<p>You can disable parts of Shatter that require network connections and similar features by going to the Blender Addon Preferences (<code>Edit</code> → <code>Preferences</code> → <code>Add ons</code>), then finding "Shatter". You can then find options to disable and enable the update notifier, the auto-updater and the quick test server.</p>
