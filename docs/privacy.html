			<h3>Telemetry</h3>
			<p>Shatter does not currently collect telemetry information; however, by continuing to use Shatter, you agree to let us turn on telemetry information by default in the future.</p>
			<h3>User IDs</h3>
			<p>Each install of Shatter is given a random user ID that is generated on your device. This user ID is never submitted to servers, but may be included in exported segment files.</p>
			<h3>Connection to external services</h3>
			<p>Shatter developers do not use online services to store personal information unless you explicitly provide it to us; however, there are <b>some features of Shatter that connect to the internet</b> which <b>may collect personally identifiable information</b>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The automatic updater <b>requests files from GitHub servers</b>. Please see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">GitHub's privacy statement</a>.</li>
				<li>Shatter may <b>download information about blocked users</b> to see if your user ID has been blocked from using Shatter.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Update security</h3>
			<p>Most downloads, including all of them that contain executeable code, use digital signatures to verify that the recieved data has come from or been authorised by the Shatter developers.</p>
			<p>However, we should note that automatic updates are still a risk if both the account is hacked and the private signing key is leaked. If you are concerned about this, you can disable the automatic updater in the addon settings.</p>
			<h3>Quick test server</h3>
			<p>There are also features which require hosting a webserver, which <b>might be exposed to the public</b> if your network is configured incorrectly:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The quick test feature requires <b>hosting a webserver</b> which does not serve anything but files at semi-hardcoded file paths.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Network settings</h3>
			<p>You can disable parts of Shatter that require network connections and similar features by going to the Blender Addon Preferences (<code>Edit</code> → <code>Preferences</code> → <code>Add ons</code>), then finding "Shatter". You can then find options to disable and enable the update notifier, the auto-updater and the quick test server as well as other network features.</p>
			<h3>Reporting security issues</h3>
			<p>There has currently been no external security audit. If you find an issue or want to preform an audit, please report it to one of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Knot126 via Email: <span id="name-WTJSa1pYQndjSEF5TlRZZ1cyRjBYU0JuYldGcGJDQmJaRzkwWFNCamIyMA" onclick="decodeName('WTJSa1pYQndjSEF5TlRZZ1cyRjBYU0JuYldGcGJDQmJaRzkwWFNCamIyMA')" style="color: #66e0ff; cursor: pointer;">Click to see email</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>If you send an email or DM about non-security related issues, you will most likely be blocked.</b> Please keep discussion public unless it is sensitive.</p>
