			<details>
				<summary>Do you really think a Blender add-on is the best level editor for a mobile game?</summary>
				<p>For many games, we know it's probably not. From the start of the project, we did not intend to create the best possible editor; instead, we wanted to make some form of segment editing possible without resorting to editing text files, and more importantly, see what and what not to do in order to make a good editor.</p>
				<p>From the <a href="https://smashingmods.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Knot126/Smash_Hit_Blender_Tools_Beta_Now_Out!">original Shatter for Blender blog post</a>:</p>
				<p><i>"Really, this plugin is more about giving future flexibility and helping spot issues that would be helpful to know in the future."</i></p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary>Is there an Android version of Shatter?</summary>
				<p>Unfortunately, Shatter for Blender is not available for Android because Blender is not available for Android. Also, keep in mind that there are very few 3D level editors for games on mobile in general for good reasons &mdash; the experience would be painful!</p>
