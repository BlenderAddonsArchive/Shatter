			<h2>What can it do?</h2>
			<p>Blender Tools is an extension for Blender that allows creating Smash Hit segments. It can do most of the things needed to create a complete segment, which includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create Smash Hit segments with boxes, obstacles, decals, power-ups and water.</li>
				<li>Import other Smash Hit segments for learning and modifying.</li>
				<li>Export LitMesh files alongside segments which look nearly indistinguishable from the official ones.</li>
				<li>Make both compressed and uncompressed segment output.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
			
			<h3>Where can I learn how to use Blender Tools?</h3>
			<p>There are two official resources for learning Blender Tools: <a href="https://github.com/knot126/Smash-Hit-Blender-Tools/wiki">the Wiki</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lOKwOG5hg6yscbrZwv4cXlM3tiHMrud">a short video series</a>. You might find the videos easier to understand, though you are free to choose what you like.</p>
			
			<h3>Can I haz android apk link plz?</h3>
			<p>Unfortunately, Blender Tools is not available for Android because Blender is not available for Android. Also, keep in mind that there are very few 3D level editors for games on mobile in general for good reasons &mdash; the experience would be painful!</p>
			<p>If you really need to make levels on Android, you can try <a href="https://github.com/knot126/Carambola/releases/download/2021-10-17/Carambola_2021-10-17.apk">Carambola 2021-10-17</a>, though please note that Carambola does not receive updates anymore.</p>
			
			<h3>I found a bug. Where do I report it?</h3>
			<p>Please submit bugs to the <a href="https://github.com/knot126/Smash-Hit-Blender-Tools/issues">issue tracker on GitHub</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Where can I submit a feature request?</h3>
			<p>Please submit feature requests to the <a href="https://github.com/knot126/Smash-Hit-Blender-Tools/issues">issue tracker on GitHub</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Do you really think a Blender add-on is the best level editor for a mobile game?</h3>
			<p>For many games, we know it's probably not. From the start of the project, we did not intend to create the best possible editor; instead, we wanted to make some form of segment editing possible without resorting to editing text files, and more importantly, see what and what not to do in order to make a good editor.</p>
			<p>From the <a href="https://smashingmods.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Knot126/Smash_Hit_Blender_Tools_Beta_Now_Out!">original Blender Tools blog post</a>:</p>
			<p><i>"Really, this plugin is more about giving future flexibility and helping spot issues that would be helpful to know in the future."</i></p>
			
			<h3>Why does the Carambola website redirect here?</h3>
			<p>Since the website is more popular on Google, it is more helpful if the website leads to a better maintained level editor. If you still want to visit the old site, <a href="https://github.com/knot126/Carambola/archive/391a06d9f65e4664dd5bd3887893efb789ae872c.zip">download this zip file</a>, extract it and view the HTML files in the website folder.</p>
